## Task 2

## Different Sized Packages

In this variation of the system, it was asked that the packages have different sizes. To do this, we changed the ```generate_package``` function from the package record to generate a package with minumum size 1 and maximum size ```MAX_PACKAGE_SIZE```.

Using the rand module, we can use 'rand:uniform' to generate a pseudo-random integer with normal distribution in a given range.
